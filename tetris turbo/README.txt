1.place the tetris.cpp in BIN
2.run

also i made this in windows 10 but in older versions the directory to BGI is different 
so if you're using an older version of windows/turbo c++ you might have to go into 
.cpp and edit the path c:\\turboc3\\bgi (//EDIT HERE comment is given in the code)


-----------------------------------a word from the creator (not imp)--------------------------------------

yeah this is my first game i created
it runs in turbo c++

why did i use turbo c++?
well...my school still uses it 
(p.s. i'm out of school now)

plus it doesn't really have a lot of higher level functions
i.e. i had to make it line by line pixel by pixel and you gotta admit that's kinda cool and og
